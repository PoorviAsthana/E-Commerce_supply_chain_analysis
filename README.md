# E-Commerce_supply_chain_analysis
The objective of this project is to analyze the performance of an e-commerce supply chain using data from various product categories. It focuses on understanding the relationships between pricing, inventory, and sales, while also identifying a comprehensive view of the supply chain.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project overview
This project performs an in-depth analysis of e-commerce supply chain data, exploring key metrics such as product type, SKU, price, availability, number of products sold, and revenue. It covers the variation for the attributes like different genders, shipping modes, region wise sales, etc.The goal is to uncover insights into product performance, sales trends, inventory management, and pricing strategies. The analysis leverages Python and its popular libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn & Plotly for data manipulation, visualization, and trend analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset consists some of the following columns:
- **Product Type**: The category of the product (e.g., electronics, clothing, home goods).
- **SKU**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Price**: Retail price of the product.
- **Availability**: Number of units of the product currently in stock.
- **Number of Products Sold**: The quantity of products sold over a specific time period.
- **Revenue**: The total revenue generated by the product.
